## 📖 Overview
Stroke is a **leading global health threat**, responsible for millions of deaths and disabilities each year.  
This project develops a **Python-based, modular, command-line analytics system** to identify and evaluate **behavioural and clinical risk factors** of stroke, such as:
- Hypertension  
- Smoking  
- Sleep patterns  
- Cardiovascular comorbidities  

The system is designed to be **scalable, interpretable, and user-friendly**, targeting both **academic and clinical use cases**.

## ✨ Features
- **Modular Design** → `dataset_module`, `query_module`, `bimodule` for flexibility and scalability.  
- **Data Preprocessing** → Handles missing values, inconsistent labels, and categorical encoding.  
- **Descriptive & Advanced Analytics** → Supports subgroup analysis, cross-tab queries, and statistical summaries.  
- **Sleep/Stroke Analysis** → Evaluates the relationship between sleep hours and stroke risk.  
- **User Interface** → Interactive **Command Line Interface (CLI)** with color-coded outputs for accessibility.  
- **CSV Export** → Query results can be exported for reuse, replication, and audits.
